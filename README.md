This is a starter template for [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn).

Here are a helpful set of commands to run when you first start the application:

1. `git checkout main` (This will take you to the main branch)
2. `git pull` (This will pull the latest changes)
3. `npm install` (This will install the latest dependencies anyone has added)
4. `npm run push` (This will sync the prisma schema with the actual mongo database)
5. `npx prisma generate` (This will sync the prisma client with the prisma schema)
6. Open up two terminals (Can use VS Code or just a terminal app of your choosing)
7. On one terminal run, `npm run dev` (This will start the development server)
8. On the other terminal run, `npm run studio` (This will open up prisma studio)

Some optional commands:

1. Run `npm run pretty` to prettyify your code before commiting! (This will ensure a consistent style across the app)
